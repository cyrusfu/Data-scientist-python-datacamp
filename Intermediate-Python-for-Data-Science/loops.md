1.1 Basic While Loops
---

While loop will keep running as long as the statement is correct.
So we can set a inverted pendulum to control it.
Practice with while loop.

Example

*Python script*
```
#set a offset
offset = 8

#set a while loop with offset

While offset != 0 :
   print('correcting...')
   offset = offset - 1
   print(offset)
```

*IPythonshell*
```
<script.py> output:
    correcting...
    7
    correcting...
    6
    correcting...
    5
    correcting...
    4
    correcting...
    3
    correcting...
    2
    correcting...
    1
    correcting...
    0
```
