1.The Python Interface
---
Instructions:
Trying to do some simple colculation on python.

You can type your code in the python script and to get the out put in the IPython shell.
python script:
       
       # Example, do not modify!
        print(5 / 8)

        # Put code below here
        print(7+10)

python IPythonshell:
        
        output:
        # Example, do not modify!
        print(5 / 8)
        
        # Put code below here
        print(7+10)
        0.625
        17

**' / ' equals division, ' - ' equals minus, ' + ' equals plus, ' * ' equals times.**

**Type print to show the outcome.**


2.Any comments?
---

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. **These comments are not run as Python code**, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, # Division; it is completely ignored during execution.

Example:
code:
       # Division
       print(5 / 8)

       #Addition
       print(7 + 10)
       
outcome:

       # Division
        print(5 / 8)
        
        #Addition
        print(7 + 10)
        0.625
        17
        
And any'#'will not influence your result. They are just comments.

3.Python as calculator
---

Exponentiation: ** . This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4 ** 2 will give 16.（算平方）
Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.（取余）

Example:

Python script:

       # Addition, subtraction
       print(6 + 6)
       print(6 - 6)

       # Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
       print(6 * 5)
       print(20 / 2)
       print(15 % 7)
       print(8 ** 2)

       # How much is your $100 worth after 9 years?(10% return annually)
       print(100 * 1.1 ** 9)
